# odin-recipes

This project is a practice HTML assignment from The Odin Project. Using basic web development fundamentals, I created a simple recipe website that links to three different pages. I practiced making html boilerplates from scratch, and how to incorporate internal links, ordered lists, unordered lists, headings, and inserting images onto a web page.
